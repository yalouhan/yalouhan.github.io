                    <h3>I am primarily responsible for product design and computational design work.</h3>
                    <p>
                        We researched the current production and distribution pre-consumption stages of high-end competitive mice. Consumption stage. The post-consumer stage and the recycling stage have revealed that
                        ABS plastic, which could have been recycled, has become extremely difficult to recycle due to the silk-screening of the mouse surface and the adhesives used in the assembly process; 
                        and the assembly structure has been designed to be difficult to disassemble and reassemble due to the need to ensure the durability of the mouse.
                        The assembly structure was designed to be difficult to disassemble and reassemble due to the durability of the mouse, despite the excellent durability and slow renewal of 
                        the electronic components inside the mouse. Users are driven by the need to update the design, which results in unnecessary waste. We have redesigned our 
                        business model to address this. based on distributed production, modularising the mouse, encouraging users to enter data on the website to customise 
                        the housing and produce it locally, and when it is time for a new one The old housing is sent back to the manufacturer for a discount on the new housing, 
                        and the housing is designed with traceable graphics to allow the manufacturer to access material information. At the same time The sustainability 
                        goal is furthered by the fact that electronic components are not replaced, extending their life cycle.
